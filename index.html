    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        The structural choices in this resume webpage were made to ensure clarity and accessibility of information. 
        The use of semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> was intentional to create a well-organized and easily understandable document structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, the deliberate choice was made to utilize a straightforward, uncluttered style with minimal formatting. 
        The emphasis was on functionality; the introduction of CSS in the following section will cover aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the incorporation of a dynamic JavaScript 'Last updated' timestamp offers transparency on the most recent changes made to the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Going future, efforts are being made to integrate a responsive design in order to guarantee the best possible viewing experience on a variety of devices. Utilizing media queries and adaptable grid layouts will be necessary for this.
    </p>
    <p>
       Future updates might include the addition of a projects section to offer more in-depth details on certain successes. Project summaries, technology utilized, and links to pertinent repositories or live demos might all be included in here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A system for version control might be included into a development process to preserve transparency. This will make it possible to monitor changes over time and make codebase collaboration easier.
    </p>
    <p>
       It's crucial that you maintain your privacy. Although professional queries can use the contact details supplied, measures will be taken to guarantee that privacy requirements are followed and best practices for data protection are used.
    </p>
    <p>
       The dedication to lifelong learning is still crucial. Constant attempts will be made to stay abreast of the most recent technological developments and trends in the business, and the resume will be updated to reflect these developments.
